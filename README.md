# Express Learning Project 📝

A simple task management web application built with Node.js and Express.js as part of my backend development learning journey.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental Express.js concepts through a practical application that allows users to create, read, and manage text-based tasks or notes. It serves as a bridge between basic backend concepts and more complex applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend
- **File System (fs)** - Data persistence
- **Path module** - File path handling

## ✨ Features

- Create new tasks/notes with custom titles
- Read and display existing tasks
- Edit task content and filenames
- File-based storage system
- Clean, responsive UI
- Real-time task management

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I explored:
- Setting up an Express.js server
- Implementing REST API endpoints
- File system operations for data persistence
- Frontend-backend communication
- Basic error handling
- Static file serving
- Template rendering and dynamic content

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-learning-project.git
   cd express-learning-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   node app.js
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
